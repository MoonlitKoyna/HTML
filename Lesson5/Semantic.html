                <h2>Facts about Dogs</h2>
                <p>Dogs are truly the most precious companions, radiating love and loyalty like sunshine on a sleepy Sunday morning. Did you know that every dog has a unique nose print — just like a fingerprint? It’s their little identity badge, hidden in plain sight on that boopable snoot. Puppies dream just like we do, often twitching or making tiny barks while they chase imaginary butterflies in their sleep. Dogs are also deeply emotional; they can sense when you're feeling down and will quietly curl up beside you like a fluffy emotional support cloud. When they run around in wild little circles — called “zoomies” — that’s just pure joy overflowing. Even their tails talk: a wag to the right means they’re happy, while a wag to the left might mean they’re a bit unsure. And though people say dogs see in black and white, they can actually see soft blues and yellows — like living in a vintage pastel dream. Some dogs even carry around their favorite toys like teddy bears, showing how deeply they form emotional bonds. From their soft ears to their big hearts, dogs are pure magic wrapped in fur and love.</p>

                <p>Dogs are little bundles of magic wrapped in fur and pure love. They dream while they sleep — especially as puppies — twitching and running through imaginary fields. Each dog has a completely unique nose print, like a fingerprint, and some even carry around their favorite toys like emotional support plushies . They can sense how we feel and often cuddle up close when we’re sad, syncing their heartbeat with ours in the softest show of love. Dogs see the world in calming tones of blue and yellow, and their tails literally talk — wagging to show happiness or nervousness. When they zoom around in circles, it’s called “zoomies,” and it’s just their way of saying “I’m so happy I could fly!” Big dogs love their naps, sometimes snoozing for over 18 hours a day, while soft music and gentle rain can make them feel relaxed and safe. Honestly? Dogs are not just pets — they’re living, breathing comfort spells</p>
